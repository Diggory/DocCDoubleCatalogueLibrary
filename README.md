This is a sample Swift Package which has a target with two DocC Documetation Catlogues in its Sources directory.

This causes Xcode Version 16.2 (16C5032a) to fail to build the docs with an error.

```
Error: Unexpected argument '/Users/diggory/Code/Swift/DocCDoubleCatalogueLibrary/Sources/DocCDoubleCatalogueLibrary/SecondCatalogue.docc'
